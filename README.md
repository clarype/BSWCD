# BSWCD WorkSpace

This repository acts as a workspace for my BSWCD web based internship projects.

### Basic Interactive Web Map

This is a basic web map which could be used to show locations of points of interest. The map will have a variety of map element such as the lustering of points, setectable basemap, scale bar, mini map, controlable layers, and much more. This is a work in progress and input of any kind would greatly appreciated. To view the map [click here](https://clarype.github.io/BSWCD/). 



### Source Script

Many of scripts used in this map are based on other script from [Github](https://github.com) and other sources, and will be listed below. 



### Data

Since, most of the data will be from BSWCD this repository will be made private.
