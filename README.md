# BSWCD WorkSpace

This repository acts as a workspace for my BSWCD web based projects.

### Basic Interactive Web Map

This is a basic web map which could be used to show locations of points of interest. The map will have a variety of map element such as the lustering of points, setectable basemap, scale bar, mini map, controlable layers, and much more. This is a work in progress and input of any kind would greatly appreciated. To view the map [click here](https://clarype.github.io/BSWCD/).
